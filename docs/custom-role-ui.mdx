This guide walks through creating a custom RBAC role using the F5 Distributed
Cloud Console UI. The role grants access to manage SSL/TLS certificates and
certificate chains used by HTTP Load Balancers. For the programmatic (API)
approach, see the [API guide](./custom-role-api).

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to the F5 Distributed Cloud Console

## Step 1: Navigate to Role Management

1. Log in to the F5 Distributed Cloud Console
2. Click the **Administration** tile on the home page
3. In the left navigation menu, select **IAM** &gt; **Roles**
4. Click **+ Add Role**

## Step 2: Name the Role

Enter `cert-admin` in the **Role Name** field.

Role naming rules:

- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Must start with two lowercase letters
- Maximum 64 characters

## Step 3: Add Proxy API Groups

Certificate permissions are part of the proxy functional area. Add the
following API groups to grant certificate management access:

1. Click **+ Allowed API Groups**
2. In the search/filter field, type `ves-io-proxy`
3. Select the following API groups:

| API Group | Grants |
| --------- | ------ |
| `ves-io-proxy-read` | Read access to proxy resources including certificates |
| `ves-io-proxy-write` | Write access to proxy resources including certificates |

4. Click **Save** to confirm the selected API groups

:::note
These groups cover all proxy-related resources (HTTP Load Balancers, origins,
routes, certificates, certificate chains, etc.), not just certificates. F5 XC
organizes permissions by functional area, not by individual resource type.
:::

## Step 4: Save the Role

Review the selected API groups in the summary, then click **Save** to create
the role.

## Step 5: Verify the Role

1. Navigate to **IAM** &gt; **Roles**
2. Click **cert-admin** in the role list
3. Confirm both API groups are listed

## How F5 XC RBAC Works

F5 XC uses a three-tier permission model:

```
api_group_element  (read-only, system-defined)
       │
       ▼
   api_group       (read-only, system-defined)
       │
       ▼
     role           (full CRUD — this is what you create)
```

1. **`api_group_element`** — Defines a regex path and HTTP methods
   (e.g., `POST /api/config/.*/certificates`). System-managed; you cannot
   create, modify, or delete these.

2. **`api_group`** — A named collection of `api_group_element` references,
   organized by functional area. System-managed; you cannot create, modify, or
   delete these. Groups use naming conventions like `ves-io-proxy-read` or
   `f5xc-waap-standard-admin`.

3. **`role`** — References `api_group` names in an array. **This is the only
   tier you create.** Use the custom role endpoints to attach specific
   `api_groups` to a role.

By selecting the proxy read/write groups, the `cert-admin` role grants SSL/TLS
certificate management as part of broader proxy resource access.
